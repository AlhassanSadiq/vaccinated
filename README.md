About the Vaccination Record System

The Vaccination Record System is built on a robust technology stack, utilizing XAMPP v3.3.0 with PHP Version 8.0.7 as the local web server. This system incorporates essential web development tools including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap, and the AdminLTE Template. By leveraging these technologies, we ensure a seamless user experience coupled with enhanced functionality.

This system caters to two main types of users: Admin Users and Staff Users. Admin Users have full access to all system functionalities, including managing user accounts, vaccination records, and system information. On the other hand, Staff Users are limited to managing vaccination records within their designated area or vaccination center. They can also maintain individual records and generate printable reports as needed.
